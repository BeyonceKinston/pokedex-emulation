# pokedex-emulation

## Description
As a Pokemon enthusiast, I want to use a Pokedex to discover new Pokemon and learn more 
about them, so that I can expand my knowledge and understanding of the Pokemon universe.

When I open the Pokedex app, I expect to see a clean and intuitive interface that allows me to 
easily search for any Pokemon by name or number. Once I find a Pokemon that interests me, I 
want to be able to view detailed information about its type, abilities, and stats.
